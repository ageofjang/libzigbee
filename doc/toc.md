=== libzigbee (working title) ===

This library is intended to provide a common interface on both linux machines (in particular, the RaspberryPi) and small embedded devices (e.g. the ST Discovery ARM Cortex M series) to the Zigbee2 family of radio transceivers. This guide will explain the library API after covering setup of the transceivers, operating systems, and embedded devices.

== Prerequisites ==
These documents outline the required setup and connections to be made for getting the ZigBee radios to work in first place, as well as for connecting them to a Linux PC/Raspberry Pi or an embedded microcontroller board.
