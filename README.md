libzigbee
=========

C library for Raspberry Pi/Embedded Systems to communicate with ZigBee/XBee API modules over a serial port (tty) or UART peripheral (e.g. on STM32F4 discovery boards and similiar).

At the moment, this is barely a source-dump of work I have done for a team project at university. Things need to be cleaned up and documented more.
